# \## How ChatGPT Works (Simple Terms)

# 

# 1\. ChatGPT is trained on large amounts of text data from books, websites, and articles.

# 2\. It uses a model called a "Transformer" to understand patterns in language.

# 3\. It predicts the next word in a sentence based on the context of previous words.

# 4\. It doesn’t “think” but gives answers based on probability of words fitting together.

# 5\. More training + fine-tuning makes it better at following instructions.
